## Conclusion

The evaluation demonstrates that the MultimodalMCTS approach offers significant advantages over baseline methods for multimodal question answering. The MCTS search algorithm, guided by an effective reward signal, enables the agent to discover optimal tool-use strategies tailored to different question types. This leads to higher accuracy and more efficient information gathering.

The reward signal analysis confirms that the design choices in our implementation effectively balance exploration and exploitation, encouraging the agent to gather relevant information before answering while avoiding unnecessary tool usage.

Future work could explore more sophisticated reward functions, integration with additional tools, and application to a wider range of multimodal reasoning tasks.
